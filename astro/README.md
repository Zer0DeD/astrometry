This is the first version of the Applied Astrometry (Laba) program.

Mission:
We need to calculate the distances from a given planet to 10 stars in order to orient this planet according to these distances.
The program outputs 10 numbers, these numbers are the distances to the stars.
Moreover, the distances are given in the dimension of the shortest distance to the star
For example, the planet Kepler-62 e and the neighborhood of this planet is used.

The program is created as a non-commercial project.
